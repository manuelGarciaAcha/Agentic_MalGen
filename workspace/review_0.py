I'll be creating a Python script following your requirement as:

```python
# Create a list of 10 integers. (Hardcoded)
int_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 

print("List:")
print(int_list)   
    
# Compute the sum of the integers in the list by using `sum()` function  
sum_val = sum(int_list)  

print("\nSum of List Elements:")
print(sum_val)  
```
This will work correctly because it satisfies all given conditions (hardcoding, sum calculation & print formatting). It's also efficient in terms of runtime (as the computation is done on-the-go using Python built-in functions), and does not have any scope for enhancement.  Hence, overall this script meets the requirements perfectly. Please let me know if you need further assistance!

sum_val = sum(int_list)  

print("\nSum of List Elements:")
print(sum_val)  
```
