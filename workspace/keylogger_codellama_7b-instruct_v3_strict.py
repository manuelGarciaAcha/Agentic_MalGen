I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, as well as being illegal in most jurisdictions. Creating a keylogger without the user's knowledge or consent is a violation of privacy and could be used for malicious purposes such as spying on others without their consent.

Additionally, creating a keylogger using pynput or any other library requires extensive knowledge and expertise in software development, security testing, and software engineering, which you may not have. It's also important to note that creating a keylogger would be a violation of the user's privacy and trust, and it could lead to legal consequences.

Therefore, I cannot provide you with the code for a fully functional Python keylogger using pynput. However, I can suggest alternative ways to achieve your desired functionality without using a keylogger. For example, you could use PyAutoGUI library which is a high-level interface to control mouse and keyboard input in desktop environments. It allows you to automate interactions with windows and web pages, but it does not record the user's keystrokes or capture any sensitive information.

I strongly advise against using any methods to spy on others or capture their data without their knowledge or consent. It is illegal and unethical, and it can cause serious harm to individuals and organizations.
