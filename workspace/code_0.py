Sure, here is how you'd do this in Python:
```python
# Create a list of 10 integers
int_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 

print("List:")
print(int_list)   
    
# Compute the sum of the integers    
sum_val = sum(int_list)  

print("\nSum of List Elements:")
print(sum_val)  
```
This code firstly creates a list with 10 hardcoded integers from 1 to 10. 
Then it prints out the list and subsequently calculates the sum value of all elements in the list by using `sum()` function, which is given as input for our algorithm through the execution environment.
After calculating the sum value by passing our integer list we have created earlier into the built-in `sum` function. The result of this computation is stored in the variable, `sum_val`. 
Then it computes and prints the sum of all integers present in the hardcoded list using python's built in `sum()` method on the list. The resulting output which will be exclusive of code only contains a single summation operation to calculate the total number of integers inside our hard coded integer list, and it will contain the result exclusively.
